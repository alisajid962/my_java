# Java OOP Concepts and Core Practices

This repository contains Java code examples and projects demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and fundamental Java practices.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

* Provide clear and concise examples of OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction).
* Showcase best practices in Java programming, including design patterns and clean code.
* Serve as a learning resource for developers seeking to strengthen their understanding of Java and OOP.
* Act as a portfolio of my work relating to Java core concepts.

## Contents

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific OOP concept or Java feature:

* **`encapsulation/`**: Demonstrations of data hiding and access control.
* **`inheritance/`**: Examples of class hierarchies and inheritance relationships.
* **`polymorphism/`**: Code illustrating method overriding and overloading.
* **`abstraction/`**: Implementations of abstract classes and interfaces.
* **`design-patterns/`**: Examples of commonly used design patterns in Java.
* **`core-java/`**: Fundamental java features, such as collections, exceptions, and multithreading.
* **`projects/`**: Small projects that integrate multiple OOP concepts.

Each directory typically contains:

* **`README.md`**: A detailed explanation of the concept or feature demonstrated.
* **`.java` files**: Well-commented Java source code.
* **`build.gradle` or `pom.xml` (if applicable)**: Build configuration files.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the desired directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [directory name]
    ```
3.  **Compile and run the Java code:**
    * Using a build tool (Gradle or Maven):
        * `gradle build` or `mvn compile`
        * `gradle run` or `mvn exec:java`
    * Using the command line:
        * `javac *.java`
        * `java [MainClassName]`
4.  **Open the java files in your IDE of choice.**
